_Measure 3D positions on Earth._

This general purpose utility can be helpful for tasks as simple as leveling a picture frame or as complex as measuring angular differences in scientific research, architectural and industrial design or generating values for use in augmented and virtual reality applications.

From an initial global reference frame with the top of an iOS device pointing toward true North and perfectly level to the surface, view realtime measurements of:

- Heading
- Flight dynamics including Pitch, Roll and Yaw
- Rotation transformation in Quaternion and Matrix form
- Global coordinates including Latitude, Longitude and Altitude

Tap and hold to calculate a three-dimensional rotation relative to an arbitrary orientation.

Render position and orientation on a paired Apple Watch.
